<h1 style="text-align:center;">Smoking</h1>

<p style="colour:blue"> <i>Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains the very addictive chemical nicotine. As with heroin or other addictive drugs, the body and mind quickly get used to the nicotine in cigarettes. Soon, a person needs to have it just to feel normal. People start smoking for different reasons. Some think it looks cool. Others start because their family members or friends smoke. Almost all adult tobacco users started before they were 18 years old. Most never expected to become addicted. That's why it's so much easier to not start smoking at all.</i></p>

<p style="colour:blue"> <i>It's not only cigarettes that people get hooked on. Also beware of vaping. Battery-operated e-cigarettes use cartridges filled with nicotine, flavorings, and other harmful chemicals and turn them into a vapor that's inhaled by the user. Some people think that e-cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes because they don't contain tobacco. But the other ingredients in them are dangerous too. In fact, there are reports of serious lung damage and even death among people who use e-cigarettes. So health experts strongly warn against using them.</i></p>

<p style="colour:blue"> <i>Many of the chemicals in cigarettes, like nicotine and cyanide, are poisons that can kill in high doses. The body is smart. It goes on the defense when it's being poisoned. First-time smokers often feel pain or burning in their throat and lungs, and some even throw up the first few times they try tobacco. Over time, smoking leads to health problems such as heart disease, stroke, lung damage and many types of cancer including lung, throat, stomach, and bladder cancer.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>If you do smoke or vape and want to quit, you have lots of information and support available. Different approaches to quitting work for different people. For some, quitting cold turkey is best. Others find that a slower approach is the way to go. Some people find that it helps to go to a support group especially for teens. When quitting, know that the first few days are the hardest. So don't give up. Some people find they have a few relapses before they manage to quit for good. Staying smoke-free will give you more energy, better looks, more money in your pocket, and in the long run, more life to live!</b></p>
